# Discovery Phase Status

> Corresponds to development process: Phase 1 — Market & User Research + Phase 0 — Strategy Alignment

**Phase Goal**: Identify market opportunities, target users, and core pain points to provide input for PRD.

---

## 1.0 Strategy Alignment

- [x] Confirm project background & business objectives (from requirements doc `AD, Tech Lead, AKP.md`)
- [x] Confirm time constraint: 7-day MVP
- [x] Confirm tech constraint: lightweight stack, no complex frameworks/cloud services
- [x] Confirm success metrics (Go/No-Go criteria) → see problem-definition.md §3

## 1.1 Market Research

- [x] Competitive analysis: Notion AI / Guru / Confluence AI / Document360 / Tettra
- [x] Tech trends: RAG architecture, multi-channel Bot integration, lightweight self-hosting
- [x] Differentiation positioning: Messaging Bot integration + intent routing + lightweight self-hosting (all-in-one)
- Output: [`discovery/market-research.md`](market-research.md) ✅

## 1.2 User Research

- [x] User personas: Admin (KB administrator), End User (employee / Bot user)
- [x] Core use cases: 4 scenarios (upload / query / configure intent / analytics)
- [x] User journeys (Admin first-time setup journey + End User first query journey)
- Output: [`discovery/user-research.md`](user-research.md) ✅

## 1.3 Problem Definition & Value Validation

- [x] Core problem statement: fragmented information / low retrieval efficiency / siloed channels
- [x] Value proposition: three problems mapped to three solutions
- [x] Assumption list (A-01 ~ A-05) + MVP acceptance metrics
- Output: [`discovery/problem-definition.md`](problem-definition.md) ✅
