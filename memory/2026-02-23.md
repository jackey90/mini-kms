# 2026-02-23 Project Discussion Log

## Discussion Notes
- Conducted full gap analysis of implementation against AD, Tech Lead, AKP.md requirements
- Identified two AI Usage Scenario Examples (Section 3.2) not reflected in actual code
- Chose to implement both scenarios in code (Option A) rather than just documenting them
- Filled all remaining gaps from the analysis

## Conclusions & Decisions
- ✅ Scenario 1 (Document Parsing): Added pdfplumber-based table detection + OpenAI structuring in `document_parser.py`
- ✅ Scenario 2 (Frontend Integration): Enhanced `rag_engine.py` with channel-aware prompt instructions + Telegram 4096-char truncation
- ✅ Created `AI-USAGE.md` (required deliverable per Section 3.2 + 3.3)
- ✅ Added 3 sample documents via `scripts/generate_sample_docs.py` (HR PDF, Legal DOCX, Finance PDF)
- ✅ Added document re-parse endpoint (`POST /api/documents/{id}/reparse`) + UI button
- ✅ Added admin reclassify endpoint (`PUT /api/analytics/queries/{id}/reclassify`) + UI form on Intent Config page
- ✅ Added average latency metric to Analytics dashboard
- ✅ Created test suite: 34 unit tests covering rag_engine formatting, analytics service, intent service, document parser
