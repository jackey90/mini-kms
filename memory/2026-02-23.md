# 2026-02-23 Project Discussion Log

## Discussion Notes
- Conducted full gap analysis of implementation against AD, Tech Lead, AKP.md requirements
- Identified two AI Usage Scenario Examples (Section 3.2) not reflected in actual code
- Chose to implement both scenarios in code (Option A) rather than just documenting them

## Conclusions & Decisions
- ✅ Scenario 1 (Document Parsing): Added pdfplumber-based table detection + OpenAI structuring in `document_parser.py`. PDFs with embedded tables (e.g., HR salary grids) now get AI-structured markdown tables appended before chunking.
- ✅ Scenario 2 (Frontend Integration): Enhanced `rag_engine.py` with channel-aware prompt instructions (Telegram: plain text + emoji + 3500 char limit; Teams: bullet points + bold + markdown tables) and hard Telegram 4096-char truncation.
- ✅ Created `AI-USAGE.md` with detailed reflection on both scenarios + other AI-assisted moments (required deliverable per Section 3.2 + 3.3)
- ✅ Added `pdfplumber==0.11.4` to backend dependencies

## Open Questions
- Sample documents (2+ for demo) still need to be prepared
- Test suite coverage is still at 0%

## Related Tasks
- backend/STATUS.md
- release/STATUS.md
